  <h2>Welcome to RPi telegram!</h2>
  <p>
    This is a Mobile App which can send message thanks to Raspberry Pi.
    This app connects with a server (RPi apache) which has a Telegram client that sends the messages to the user you set to.
  </p>
  <p>
    The apache server recives a request with the user and the message it has to send. Then, the message is sent thanks to a python script which calls to the telegram client and if the user is on his contact list, it sends the message to that user.
